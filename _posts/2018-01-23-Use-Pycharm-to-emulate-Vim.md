I finally became to love Vim. It's the simplest editor I've met in my life of programming.

At first in 2016. I started to use `Intellij IDEA` which I knew from a tweet by **ItsJerryandHarry**.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en-us"><p lang="nl" dir="ltr">We use IntelliJ</p>&mdash; ItsJerryAndHarry (@JerryAndHarry) <a href="https://twitter.com/JerryAndHarry/status/784149304260853760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Oct 6, 2016</a></blockquote>

Then, I started to install this software immediately after the reply. In the plugin page, there is an option called **IdeaVim** with the description

> Enable it only if you are very familiar with Vim

But I didn't know what vim was two years ago. So I thought `it's better to enable it for future use`. This is why at first I still preferred to use Eclipse to develop Java.

After seeing some programmer's blog. I understood that Vim is a primitive text editor that allows you to use keyboard to do everything about editting. So, I started to use Vim.

The most important coding strategy I learned from vim is spliting windows. It helps me a lot on coordinating code in two files. Now, I do so in Notepad++.

Also, Vim instroduces me Linux. It lets me be interested in Linux now. So, when I'm using my computer. I always have Ubuntu Bash opened in my computer. So vim became a useful tools in writing code for linux. So, I wrote a lot of code in C language because it's Linux standard. This is also when my GitHub contributions started to be very active.

At last, my parents introduced me Data Visualization, so I started to learn Python. And recently I am doing a project that is similar to a **Crawler**. It helps me do Homework. It's [Word Voyage Sentence Fetcher](https://github.com/TravorLZH/WordVoyageSampleSentence). This is what I created with a new fresh IDE called Pycharm. In the development. I really appreciate IdeaVim because it helps me organize code with only few key strokes.

To go further, I decide to learn more about vim so that I could get rid of IDE someday.
