To address phenomena in physics, mathematicians often construct differential equations subjected to certain boundary conditions. For instance, in the study of waves, we arrive at the following problem after the separation of variables:

$$
\begin{cases}
(-\partial^2_{xx}-\lambda)u=0\text{ in }(0,\ell), \\
u(0)=u(\ell)=0.
\end{cases}\tag1
$$

Notice that the general solution is given by $u=A\sin(\lambda^{1/2}x+\varphi)$. Plugging in the boundary conditions, we conclude that the solutions of (1) are given by

$$
u=A\sin\left(n\pi x\over\ell\right),\quad \lambda={n^2\pi^2\over\ell^2},\quad n\in\mathbb Z.\tag2
$$

Observe that $-\partial^2 \_ {xx}$ is a linear operator, so we can regard (1) as an **eigenvalue problem** for $-\partial^2 \_ {xx}$ in the following vector space

$$
U_1=\lbrace u\in C^\infty([0,\ell]):u(0)=u(\ell)=0\rbrace.
$$

Consequently, (2) indicates that the spectrum (i.e. eigenvalues) of $-\partial^2 \_ {xx}$ in $U \_ 1$ is countably infinite and discrete. However, if we look at the eigenvalue problem of $-\partial^2_{xx}$ in the space

$$
U_2=\lbrace u\in C^\infty([0,+\infty))):u(0)=0\wedge u\text{ uniformly bounded}\rbrace
$$

then we arrive at the following solutions:

$$
u=A\sin(\alpha x), \quad \lambda=\alpha^2, \quad \alpha\in\mathbb R.\tag3
$$

This indicates that the spectrum of $-\partial_{xx}$ in $U_2$ is exactly $(0,+\infty)$.

Contrasting (2) and (3), we see that in infinite-dimensional vector spaces, the spectrum of linear operators can possess contrasting topological properties.

Ordinary differential equations can often be converted to integral equations (e.g. the proof of Picard-Lindel√∂f theorem), so in this article, we study the spectrum of a certain class of integral operators.

## Fredholm's integral equation

In 1903, Fredholm developed a general theory to attack the following equation:

$$
u(x)=f(x)+\int_a^b K(x,t)u(t)\mathrm dt,
$$

where $K(x,t)$, the **kernel**, is a bounded integrable function on $[a,b]^2$. The integral equation produces the following integral operator:

$$
(Ku)(x)=\int_a^b K(x,t)u(t)\mathrm dt,\tag4
$$

and we will be investigating the spectrum of this operator throughout the rest of this article.

## Transformation to a discrete problem

Let $a=x_0<x_1<x_2<\dots<x_n=b$ be a partition satisfying $x_q-x_{q-1}=(b-a)/n:=\delta$ be a partition. Then we $Ku$ should be well approximated by

$$
(K_nu)(x)=\sum_{q=1}^nK(x,x_q)u(x_q)\delta
$$

when $n\to+\infty$. Consequently, we can attack the eigenvalue problem of operator $K$ by considering the equation

$$
[(\lambda I-K_n)u](x)=0\tag5
$$

and make $n\to+\infty$. Because (5) needs to be valid for all $x\in[a,b]$, it must also be true when $x=x_p$. Consequently, we transform the eigenvalue problem into a system of linear equations:

$$
\lambda u(x_p)-\delta\sum_{q=1}^nK(x_p,x_q)u(x_q)=0\tag6
$$

for $p=1,2,\dots,n$. When $\lambda\ne0$, this equation has a unique solution if and only if the determinant ($K_{p,q}=K(x_p,x_q)$)

$$
D_n(z)=
\begin{vmatrix}
1-z\delta K_{1,1} & -z\delta K_{1,2} & -z\delta K_{1,3} & \dots & -z\delta K_{1,n} \\
-z\delta K_{2,1} & 1-z\delta K_{2,2} & -z\delta K_{2,3} & \dots & -z\delta K_{2,n} \\
-z\delta K_{3,1} & -z\delta K_{3,2} & 1-z\delta K_{3,3} & \dots & -z\delta K_{3,n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
-z\delta K_{n,1} & -z\delta K_{n,2} & -z\delta K_{n,3} & \dots & 1-z\delta K_{n,n}
\end{vmatrix}
$$

vanishes at $z=\lambda^{-1}$. To study how this determinant behaves has $n\to+\infty$, we need to expand it first into a polynomial of $z$:

### Expansion of $D_n(z)$

If $e_{p,q}$ represents the $p,q$'th entry of the identity matrix. Then the Leibniz expansion gives

$$
D_n(z)=\sum_{\sigma\in S_n}\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)\prod_{p=1}^n(e_{p,\sigma(p)}-z\delta K_{p,\sigma(p)}).\tag7
$$

Observe that

$$
\prod_{p=1}^n(\alpha_p+\beta_p)=\sum_{A\subset\lbrace 1,2,\dots,n\rbrace}\prod_{p\in A}\alpha_p\prod_{q\in A^c}\beta_q,
$$

so (7) becomes

$$
D_n(z)=\sum_{\sigma\in S_n}\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)\sum_A(-z\delta)^{\vert A\vert}\prod_{p\in A}K_{p,\sigma(p)}{\color{blue}\prod_{q\in A^c}e_{q,\sigma(q)}}.
$$

Because the blue term is zero when $\sigma$ does not fix elements of $\lbrace1,2,\dots,n\rbrace$ that is not in $A$, we only need to restrict the domain of $\sigma$ to the permutations $S_A$ of set $A$:

$$
D_n(z)=\sum_A(-z\delta)^{\vert A\vert}\sum_{\sigma\in S_A}\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)\prod_{p\in A}K_{p,\sigma(p)}=\sum_{m=0}^na_{m,n}z^m,
$$

where

$$
\begin{aligned}
a_{m,n}
&=(-\delta)^m\sum_{\vert A\vert=m}\sum_{\sigma\in S_A}\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)\prod_{p\in A}K_{p,\sigma(p)} \\
&=(-\delta)^m\sum_{1\le p_1<p_2<\dots<p_m\le n}\sum_{t\in S_m}\operatorname{sgn}(t)\prod_{k=1}^m K_{p_k,\sigma(p_k)} \\
&=(-\delta)^m\sum_{1\le p_1<p_2<\dots<p_m\le n}\det(K_{p_r,p_s})_{1\le r,s\le m} \\
&={(-\delta)^m\over m!}\sum_{\substack{1\le p_1,p_2,\dots,p_m\le n\\p_1,p_2,\dots,p_m\text{ distinct}}}\det(K_{p_r,p_s})_{1\le r,s\le m}
\end{aligned}
$$

Because the determinant is zero when its matrix has identical rows or columns, we can drop the requirement that $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_m$ are distinct, so we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
a_{m,n}
&={(-1)^m\over m!}\sum_{\substack{1\le p_1,p_2,\dots,p_m\le n}}\delta^m\det(K_{p_r,p_s})_{1\le r,s\le m} \\
&={(-1)^m\over m!}\sum_{\substack{1\le p_1,p_2,\dots,p_m\le n}}\delta^m
\begin{vmatrix}
K(x_{p_1},x_{p_1}) & K(x_{p_1},x_{p_2}) & \dots & K(x_{p_1},x_{p_m}) \\
K(x_{p_2},x_{p_1}) & K(x_{p_2},x_{p_2}) & \dots & K(x_{p_2},x_{p_m}) \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
K(x_{p_m},x_{p_1}) & K(x_{p_m},x_{p_2}) & \dots & K(x_{p_m},x_{p_m})
\end{vmatrix}.
\end{aligned}
$$

### Limit of $D_n(z)$ as $n\to+\infty$

When $n\to+\infty$, $a_{m,n}$ converges pointwise to

$$
a_m={(-1)^m\over m!}\mathop{\int\dots\int}\limits_{a\le t_1,t_2,\dots,t_m\le b}
\begin{vmatrix}
K(t_1,t_1) & K(t_1,t_2) & \dots & K(t_1,t_n) \\
K(t_2,t_1) & K(t_2,t_2) & \dots & K(t_2,t_n) \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
K(t_n,t_1) & K(t_n,t_2) & \dots & K(t_n,t_n)
\end{vmatrix}
\mathrm dt_1\mathrm dt_2\cdots\mathrm dt_n.
$$

By our assumption, $\vert K(x,y)\vert\le A$ for some fixed $A>0$ throughout $(x,y)\in [a,b]^2$, so Hadamard's inequality gives

$$
\begin{aligned}
\vert m!a_{m,n}\vert
&\le\delta^m\sum_{1\le p_1,p_2,\dots,p_m\le n}\prod_{r=1}^m\left(\sum_{s=1}^m\vert K(x_{p_s},x_{p_r})\vert^2\right)^{1/2} \\
&\le\delta^mn^m\prod_{r=1}^m(m^{1/2}A)=m^{m/2}[(b-a)A]^m
\end{aligned}
$$

From Stirling's approximation $m!\sim\sqrt{2\pi} m^{m+\frac12}e^{-m}$, we see that

$$
\vert a_{m,n}\vert\le Cm^{-m/2}[(b-a)eA]^m,\tag8
$$

for some fixed $C>0$ and all $n$ so by the dominated convergence theorem, we conclude that

$$
D_n(z)\to D(z)=\sum_{m\ge0}a_mz^m
$$

uniformly for all $z$ in any compact subset of $\mathbb C$, so $D(z)$ is an entire function.

## The spectrum of $K$

By the nature of determinants, we conclude that $\lambda\ne0$ is an eigenvalue of the operator $K$ if and only if $D(\lambda^{-1})=0$. Because an entire function can either have no zeros, finitely many zeros, or countably many zeros accumulating at infinity, we conclude that the spectrum $\sigma(K)$ of operator $K$ defined by (4) belongs to exactly one of the following kinds:

1. $\sigma(K)$ is empty.
2. $\sigma(K)$ is finite.
3. $\sigma(K)$ is countably infinite and accumulates at zero.

This indicates that the fundamental reason for certain operators to possess a discrete spectrum is that it is characterized by the zeros of some analytic function.
